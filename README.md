## ✅ Repository Clone
Use this command to clone my project locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goldenkumar97/Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe.git

```
This creates a folder named Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe on your computer with all project files.

## 📌 Overview

Smart Tic-Tac-Toe is a Java-based desktop game developed using Java Swing.
The project provides an interactive graphical user interface and supports both:

    • Player vs Computer (Smart AI)

    • Player vs Player (Two-player mode)

The computer opponent uses the Minimax Algorithm, making it unbeatable.
This project is ideal for learning Java GUI development, event-driven programming, and basic Artificial Intelligence concepts.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

   • Programming Language: Java

   • GUI Framework: Java Swing

   • Concepts Implemented:

       • Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

       • Event Handling

       • Game Logic

       • Artificial Intelligence (Minimax Algorithm)

---       
## 🎯 Game Modes
    1️⃣ Player vs Computer

       • The computer uses the Minimax Algorithm

       • It evaluates all possible moves before playing

       • The computer cannot be defeated

       • Result is always Win or Draw

    2️⃣ Player vs Player

       • Two players can play on the same system

       • Turns alternate between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O)

---  
## 🧠 AI Logic – Minimax Algorithm
The AI opponent is powered by the Minimax Algorithm, a classic decision-making algorithm used in game theory.

How it works:
    • Explores all possible future moves

    • Evaluates game states for both players

    • Chooses the move that maximizes its chance of winning

    • Minimizes the opponent’s advantage

Result:

    • perfect decision-making

    • No random moves

    • Guarantees optimal gameplay

This makes the computer player unbeatable.
